# Cleanthis

Just use this if you want to clean a folder and move the contents into a backup folder 
in your home directory. Check the code if necessary. Additionally, this code is suitable 
to be placed in `$HOME/.local/bin`. Change the file permissions to make it *executable* so you can run it from anywhere.
